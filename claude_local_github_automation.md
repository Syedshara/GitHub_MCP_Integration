# Claude Local Files + GitHub Automation Setup

## Overview: What We're Building

You'll now have TWO MCP servers connected to Claude:
1. **GitHub MCP** - To create repos and push code (already done âœ…)
2. **Filesystem MCP** - To access your local VS Code project files (NEW)

This lets Claude:
- Read your project files from your Mac
- Make changes to files if needed
- Create a GitHub repository
- Commit and push everything to GitHub

---

## Step 1: Update Your Configuration File

Open Terminal and edit your Claude config:

```bash
nano ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

Replace the entire content with this (add the filesystem server while keeping GitHub):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your token"
      }
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/mog/Documents", "/Users/mog/Desktop", "/Users/mog/Projects"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Important: Replace the Paths!

Replace these paths with where your VS Code projects actually are:
- `/Users/mog/Documents` - Example path, use your actual username and directory
- `/Users/mog/Desktop` - Where your project might be
- `/Users/mog/Projects` - Where you keep projects (create if needed)

**To find your projects path:**
```bash
pwd
```

This shows your current directory. If your project is in a folder called "my-project", use:
```
/Users/mog/my-project
```

---

## Step 2: Save the Configuration

In nano editor:
1. Press `Control + X`
2. Press `Y` (yes to save)
3. Press `Enter` (confirm filename)

Verify it saved:
```bash
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

---

## Step 3: Restart Claude Desktop

1. Completely close Claude Desktop (âŒ˜+Q)
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Open Claude Desktop again (Cmd+Space, type "Claude")

---

## Step 4: Check Both MCP Servers are Connected

In Claude, ask:
```
What tools do you have available?
```

You should see:
- **GitHub tools** (list_repos, create_repository, create_pull_request, etc.)
- **Filesystem tools** (read_file, write_file, list_directory, etc.)

Look for a **hammer icon** in the bottom right of the input box. Click it to see all available tools.

---

## Step 5: Now Automate Your Workflow!

### Example 1: Push Existing Project to GitHub

Let's say you have a project at `/Users/mog/my-project`. Ask Claude:

```
I have a project at /Users/mog/my-project. 
Please:
1. Read all the files in this directory
2. Create a new GitHub repository called "my-project"
3. Initialize git in the project
4. Add all files
5. Make an initial commit
6. Push to GitHub

My GitHub username is: mog
```

### Example 2: Create and Push a New Project

```
Create a new folder called "my-app" in /Users/mog/Desktop
Then:
1. Create an initial README.md with project description
2. Create a .gitignore file
3. Create a GitHub repository called "my-app"
4. Initialize git and push everything to GitHub

My GitHub username is: mog
```

### Example 3: Update Existing Code and Push

```
1. Update the file at /Users/mog/my-project/index.js with [your changes]
2. Commit the changes with message "Update index.js"
3. Push to GitHub repository "my-project"

My GitHub username is: mog
```

---

## Complete Automation Example

Here's a detailed example you can copy and customize:

```
I want to create and push a project. Here's what I need:

1. Create a new folder: /Users/mog/my-automation-project
2. Create these files inside:
   - README.md (with title "My Automation Project")
   - main.py (with simple Python code)
   - .gitignore (ignore __pycache__ and .env)

3. Initialize a Git repository
4. Create a GitHub repository called "my-automation-project"
5. Add all files to git
6. Make initial commit with message "Initial commit"
7. Push to GitHub

My GitHub username is: mog
```

## How It Works: Complete Flow

```
You ask Claude in Claude Desktop
          â†“
Claude reads your local files (via Filesystem MCP)
          â†“
Claude understands your project structure
          â†“
Claude uses GitHub MCP to create repository
          â†“
Claude uses Filesystem MCP to initialize git repo
          â†“
Claude stages files and commits
          â†“
Claude pushes to GitHub using your token
          â†“
Files appear on GitHub.com ðŸŽ‰
```

---

## Important Notes

### Security
- Your GitHub token is in the config file - **keep it private**
- Filesystem MCP can only access directories you listed
- Claude asks for permission before modifying files (usually)

### Common Issues

**Issue: "Permission denied" when creating directories**
```bash
# Make sure you have write permissions
ls -la /Users/mog/
```

**Issue: Filesystem tools not appearing**
- Restart Claude Desktop completely
- Check that paths are correct absolute paths (not relative)
- Verify JSON syntax

**Issue: Git is not found**
Claude might say "git not found". You need to:
```bash
git --version
```

If not installed, install from https://git-scm.com/

---

## Testing Step-by-Step

### Test 1: Filesystem Access
Ask Claude:
```
List all files and folders in /Users/mog/Desktop
```

Claude should show you the contents.

### Test 2: GitHub Access
Ask Claude:
```
List my GitHub repositories
```

Claude should show your repos.

### Test 3: Combined
Ask Claude:
```
Read the file at /Users/mog/Desktop/test.txt
Then create a GitHub repository called "test-repo"
```

If both work, you're ready! âœ…

## Recommended Workflow for Your Projects

**For NEW projects:**
```
Ask Claude:
"Create a new project in /Users/mog/Projects called [project-name] with these files: [list files]
Then push to GitHub as [repo-name]"
```

**For EXISTING projects:**
```
Ask Claude:
"Push the project at /Users/mog/path/to/project to GitHub as [repo-name]"
```

**For UPDATES:**
```
Ask Claude:
"Update [filename] in /Users/mog/project with [changes]
Then commit and push with message: [commit message]"
```

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Update your config with both MCP servers
2. âœ… Restart Claude Desktop
3. âœ… Test with simple commands
4. âœ… Start automating your workflows!

Once this is working, Claude becomes your development assistant that can:
- Create projects
- Read and modify files
- Manage Git repositories
- Push to GitHub
- All from natural language! ðŸš€
